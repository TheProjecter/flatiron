- How to make templates -

-- The basics --
drop into code:
<% do_stuff() %> 

output the value of the expression:
<%= person.name %>

evaluate the file named by evaluating the expression, insert the content from its default section:
<%include 'navigation.inc.html' %>

-- Parenting --

Every template can have a parent. The parent can insert named 'sections' defined within the child template into itself. This is similar to Rails' view/layout metaphor, except you're not constrained to a two-deep structure--your layouts can have layouts.

Set the parent of the current template:
<%set-parent 'default_layout.tmpl.html' %>

Similar to Rails' "content_for" mechanism, this syntax causes the template to start writing to the section named by evaluating the expression:
<%set-section 'right_sidebar' %>
Start writing to the default section again:
<%set-section%>

Similar to Rails' 'yield' mechanism, this syntax inserts the child section named by evaluating the expression.
<%get-section 'head' %>
<%get-section %>
